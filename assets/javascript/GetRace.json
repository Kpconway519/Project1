Your support ensures that more children, particularly young men, in our communities will have the chance to realize their potential and make healthy choices. At the Kappa Foundation of Charlotte and the American Heart Association / American Stroke Association, we are committed to being good stewards of your contributions.</p>\r\n<p>Kappa Foundation of Charlotte<br/>The Kappa Foundation of Charlotte strives to foster exceptional achievement amongst young men in the Charlotte / Mecklenburg County community through diligent role modeling, mentoring, structured involvement and open access to economic scholarship and resources. To this end, the Foundation hosts two primary programs - Kappa League and the Beautillion Militaire (our 40th year running, focused college preparatory and life skills program). Kappa League is rooted in the spirit of assisting young men who are in need of counsel, advice and positive role models to aid in the navigation of their journey from childhood to manhood, particularly from a personal and scholastic development perspective. Just over the last four years, more than 135 young men have participated in the Kappa League Program.</p>\r\n<p>Beautillion Militaire focuses on advanced mentoring and facilitates scholarships for students in area high schools pursuing further degrees at four-year collegiate institutions. The Beautillion Militaire raised over $225,000 in merit and community based scholarship funds for greater than 100 young men.</p>\r\n<p>The Healthy Achievement 5K, along with its primary presenter, the Kappa Foundation of Charlotte, Inc., depends on the generosity of private donors, corporations, foundations and special events.

Learn about the lifesaving work of the American Heart Association. Since 1924, we have been working to keep you, your loved ones and your community safe from heart disease and stroke.</p>\r\n<p>Important Facts to Consider:</p>\r\n<p>Blacks have almost twice the risk of first-ever strokes compared to whites.<br/>Blacks have higher death rates for stroke compared to whites.<br/>The prevalence of high blood pressure in African Americans in the United States is the highest in the world.<br/>Among non-Hispanic blacks age 20 and older, 62.9 percent of men and 77.2 percent of women are overweight or obese.<br/>In 2001, 27.7 percent of black or African-Americans only, used any tobacco product. Heavy cigarette smoking approximately doubles a person's risk for stroke when compared to light smokers.<br/>Black women have higher prevalence rates of high blood pressure, obesity, physical inactivity and diabetes than white women.<br/>We're building healthier lives where you live and work and making your community healthier by advocating for key health issues. We train millions of Americans each year in CPR and first aid, and educate healthcare providers every day.</p>\r\n<p>Each year we host multiple events in Charlotte community to bring awareness and education about our key issues and to raise support for invaluable heart disease and stroke research.

Although the overall racial disparity in cancer death rates is decreasing, in 2007 the death rate for all cancers combined continued to be 32% higher in African American men and 16% higher in African American women than in white men and women, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>About 168,900 new cancer cases were expected to be diagnosed among African Americans in 2011. The most common of these among African American men are prostate (40%), lung (15%), and colon and rectum (9%). Among African American women, the most common cancers are breast (34%), lung (13%), and colorectum (11%).</p>\r\n<p>Help fight back, get involved and make a difference in the fight against cancer by participating in the Healthy Achievement 5K Run | Walk.

You'll eat one slice 5 minutes before the start time, and consume your second slice at the &quot;pizza station&quot;, about half-way through the course.</p>\r\n<p>The first runner to cross the finish line will be crowned &quot;The Pizza King (or Queen)&quot; (&lt;---- they get a special award!).</p>\r\n<p>Why? Because everyone will run for pizza.</p>\r\n<p>This event will happen at Mallard Creek Park.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;What do I get?</h2>\r\n<p>Every finisher will receive a medal, t-shirt, an opportunity to interact with local sponsors, and an epic great time.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A custom pizza medal (image to be posted at a later date, but believe me - you'll like the medal).</li>\r\n<li>An awesome race shirt to show off!</li>\r\n<li>Pizza King and Queen&nbsp;ceremony directly after the race.</li>\r\n<li>Free access to race photos.</li>\r\n<li>Pizza is included with your registration!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>What's Allowed?</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Strollers and wheelchairs are allowed on this course, but participants MUST stay to the right of the path to allow for passers.</li>\r\n<li>Service animals.</li>\r\n<li>Headphones are authorized, but&nbsp;we ask that you keep to a volume that allows you to hear race and park officials.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>What's NOT Allowed?</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pets (except certified service animals).</li>\r\n<li>Double-wide (or wider) strollers.&nbsp; At some points on the course, the path isn't wide enough for three adults.</li>\r\n<li>Skateboards, bicycles, tricycles, skates, etc...</li>\r\n<li>Bandits. If you're not wearing a bib at the finish line, you won't get a medal!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">***For obvious reasons, this event is not certified.&nbsp; Runners <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>WILL NOT</strong></span> receive a certified time.&nbsp; Bibs will <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>not</strong></span> have chips on them.&nbsp; This is a FUN RUN!***</span></p>\r\n<h2>Allergy and Dietary Restrictions.</h2>\r\n<p>As much as we'd like to, we CANNOT accomodate for allergy or dietary restrictions such as gluten-free pizza.
